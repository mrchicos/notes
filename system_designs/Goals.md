## System Design Interview Assessment

The Architecture interview will challenge you to design the architecture for XXX. You will be asked to draw a system diagram representing various components (such as services, databases, queues, etc.) to illustrate your architectural design given some assumptions and constraints that our engineers will provide. The goal is to evaluate your problem-solving skills, your understanding of software and system architecture principles, and your ability to make informed decisions in a limited time frame.

### Key Concepts to Review

#### Communication Patterns
- Understand the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication. 
- Be prepared to discuss when each is appropriate and the implications of using one over the other in various scenarios.
#### Distributed systems
- Have a solid understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of services and monolithic architectures. 
- Be prepared to justify your architectural choices based on the requirements of the system.
#### Scalability and Performance
- Consider how your architecture can scale to handle increased load. Discuss strategies for optimising performance and ensuring responsiveness.
#### Reliability and Fault Tolerance
- Explore techniques for ensuring the reliability and fault tolerance of the system. Discuss redundancy, error handling, and recovery mechanisms.
#### Caching Layers
- Explore the role of caching in improving system performance. Be ready to discuss different caching strategies and their impact on the overall architecture."
